Botpress can seem intimidating at first, but it is, in fact, straightforward once you understand how it works and why. Let‚Äôs dissect all the major components of a Botpress bot.

üåü **Tip:** You may skip this section if you are already familiar with bot building.

## Modules <a class="toc" id="modules" href="#modules"></a>

A module is an extra component outside of the Botpress Core itself that you can install in your bot to add new features to Botpress. Every bot uses modules in a way since almost everything in Botpress is a module. This architecture allows for maximum flexibility and freedom for developers. There are three informal categories of modules: **channels**, **skills** and **functionals**.

## Channels <a class="toc" id="channels" href="#channels"></a>

A **channel** is a module that allows your bot to send and receive messages from a specific chat platform (Slack, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc.).

> **Note**: Unlike most other bot platforms, channels are installed and configured individually and locally, which means you have full control over the data that is transmitted between your bot and the chat platforms. Botpress does not proxy the messages to a 3rd party service as Microsoft Bot Framework does.

Behind the scenes, Botpress implements a queuing mechanism that processes ingoing and outgoing messages sequentially. If a message fails to be processed or sent for some reason, the message will be retried before raising an error to the developer and bot administrator.

## NLU <a class="toc" id="nlu" href="#nlu"></a>

**Natural Language Understanding** (or **NLU**) involves your bot taking the messages received from the chat platforms, which are pure unstructured text, and transforming them into structured data that your bot will be able to work with.

Although NLU is optional, a bot without NLU would have to rely on obsolete techniques such as keywords detection to process the incoming messages and reply correctly.

NLU is a subset of NLP (_Natural Language Processing_). NLU is, in general, a very complex subject involving linguistics and machine learning. Fortunately, there are many providers that allow us to abstract all these complexities, such as [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) (Microsoft), [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) (Google), [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/) and [RASA](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu).

NLU is available in Botpress by installing the [`botpress-nlu`](https://github.com/botpress/modules/tree/master/functionals/botpress-nlu) module and can be connected to any of these providers.

## Dialogue Manager <a class="toc" id="dialogue" href="#dialogue"></a>

Once you‚Äôve received some text from a chat platform and transformed that text into structured data, the next component to be involved is the **Dialogue Manager** (or **DM**). The role of the DM is to determine what the bot should do or say next.

Although the Dialogue Manager could theoretically be implemented as a bunch of ‚ÄúIf‚Äù and ‚ÄúElse‚Äù statements, this technique does not scale well in practice, because the unpredictability of natural dialogues increases the complexity of this kind of state machine exponentially.

Botpress solves this problem by combining an extensible Visual Flow Editor with a powerful Dialogue Manager, which abstracts and eliminate the real complexity behind such State Machines.

## Content Elements (and Content Renderers) <a class="toc" id="content" href="#content"></a>

Now that the DM has decided that your bot should reply with a certain message, there are a couple of pieces of information required before the message can be sent out to the user: what kind of message should it send and how is that message going to be rendered on the different chat platforms?

That is what **Content Elements** are for. A Content Element can be seen as a structured object that holds information about what to say, and a Content Renderer is a function that transforms that structured object into a platform-specific message.

The purpose of a Content Renderer is to allow developers to specify how the same information should behave (i.e., be displayed) on the different chat platforms.

## Summary

Channels, which are a special kind of module, receive messages from the different chat platforms. These messages are then processed by NLU so that the natural text is turned into structured data the bot understands. The Dialog Manager decides what the bot needs to say next, which the Content Renderer turns into a message specific to the target chat platform.
